# Protractor Sample project for a very basic first test #

This is just a bare bones boilerplate and first test used to demo how to setup and start with protractor and Page Object Model (Or Page Object Pattern).

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open a terminal and install the dependencies:
```
    npm install
```
2. In your terminal access the repo directory and type the following to start webdriver-manager:
```
    npm run serve
```
3. Open a second terminal and type the following to run the test.
```
    npm test
```

From this bare bones template you can start working your way up to an automated solution for your project using Page Object Model, refer to [protractor's API documentation](http://www.protractortest.org/#/api) for details on methods you can use to test.

That's it,
enjoy.
